##Technical Approach

Informatix Inc. is a minority-owned, Sacramento-based technology company that has provided information technology solutions
and services to government and private industry for 30 years. Our response team for the Pre-Qualified Vendor Pool for
Digital Services â€“ Agile Development RFI utilized an agile human centered approach to create our ADPQ prototype. We focused 
on the needs of the end users which drove our feature development and our application program interfaces (API) integration.  
We started with a discovery that included surveys, research, and interviews and focus groups with users which was conducted  continuously throughout the iterations. This continuous feedback promoted end user adoption and satisfaction.
